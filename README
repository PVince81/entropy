Entropy

By Vincent Petry <PVince81@yahoo.fr>

Bouncing balls with minimal physics.


Entropy comes in two versions:
1) Python version

The Python version was developed using Pygame (http://www.pygame.org/)

2) HTML5 version

The HTML5 version has two renderers, one uses the regular drawing functions of
the HTML5 canvas (entropy.html) and the other one uses WebGL (entroy_gl.html).

I have found out that the WebGL version is as smooth as the Python version with
1000 particles.
