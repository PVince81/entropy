Entropy

By Vincent Petry <PVince81@yahoo.fr>

Bouncing balls with minimal physics.


Entropy comes in two versions:
1) Python version

The Python version was developed using Pygame (http://www.pygame.org/)

2) HTML5 version

The HTML5 version has two renderers, one uses the regular drawing functions of
the HTML5 canvas (entropy.html) and the other one uses WebGL (entroy_gl.html).

I have found out that the WebGL version is as smooth as the Python version with
1000 particles.

3) CSS version

The CSS version is using absolute SPAN elements and modifies their position dynamically.
These elements have a CSS3 radial gradient applied to them.
