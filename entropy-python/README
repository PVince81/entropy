Entropy

By Vincent Petry <PVince81@yahoo.fr>

Bouncing balls with minimal physics.



Entropy requires pygame (http://www.pygame.org/)

You can change the configuration by editing the config.py file.

The accelerometer feature currently only works on the Nokia N900.

It is possible to use multiple mice if pymanymouse is installed.
You might have to set the PYTHONPATH to point to the directory
where pymanymouse is installed.
